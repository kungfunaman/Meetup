***IMPORTANT NOTICE***
  First of all I am sorry that the pages are not classified in any observable
order. But there is a pattern. The files with name of type *meetup_(@@@@).php*
are the webpages. The files with name of type *stylesheet(@).css* are the css
codes. The files with name which is of none the above types are the php codes.
Also, there are two files named login_system, here one of them is a php code and
the other one is the sql code which you would need to import into xampp with
database name as login_system.

  The first page of the website is **meetup_home.php** and I have used xampp
offline server for linking php and sql to the website so please use teh same or
make the changes accordingly.

    THANK YOU.
